## Introduction

Py**T**orch **Im**age **M**odels (`timm`) is a collection of image models, layers, utilities, optimizers, schedulers, data-loaders / augmentations, and reference training / validation scripts that aim to pull together a wide variety of SOTA models with ability to reproduce ImageNet training results.

The work of many others is present here. I've tried to make sure all source material is acknowledged via links to github, arxiv papers, etc in the README, documentation, and code docstrings. Please let me know if I missed anything.
